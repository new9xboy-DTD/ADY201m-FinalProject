    "\n",
    "1.1. Activity name: Build a machine learning model in Python with a dataset of your choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.2. Objectives:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Master the basic workflow of building a machine learning model.\n",
    "* Apply skills in data preprocessing, visualization, model selection, and model evaluation.\n",
    "* Practice using Python and popular machine learning libraries (such as caret, randomForest, e1071, glmnet, xgboost, etc.).\n",
    "* Develop skills in presenting results in a reproducible notebook format.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. DETAILED REQUIREMENTS\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Select an appropriate dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "* Must contain at least 500 rows of data and 5 or more feature columns.\n",
    "* Can be selected from: UCI, Kaggle, OpenML, or available datasets in R (iris, mtcars, airquality, Boston, diamonds, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Modeling objective\n",
    "\n",
    "* Choose a classification or regression problem suitable for the dataset.\n",
    "* Clearly specify target variable and feature variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Data preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "* Check and handle missing values.\n",
    "* Normalize or transform data if necessary (One-Hot Encoding, Scaling, etc.).\n",
    "* Split the dataset into train/test sets (e.g.: 70/30 or 80/20).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Data visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "* Provide visual representations (histogram, boxplot, scatterplot, correlation heatmap, etc.).\n",
    "* Analyze relationships and distribution of variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Train machine learning model\n",
    "\n",
    "* Apply at least one machine learning model (e.g.: linear regression, logistic regression, random forest, decision tree, SVM, kNN, xgboost, etc.).\n",
    "* Perform hyperparameter tuning if possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Model evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use appropriate evaluation metrics:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Regression: RMSE, MAE, R²\n",
    "  * Classification: Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Precision/Recall/F1-score, ROC/AUC\n",
    "* Provide remarks on model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Documentation in Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "* Code must include clear comments and explanation.\n",
    "* Present analysis, model selection rationale, and well-founded conclusions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. PROJECT REQUIREMENTS\n",
    "\n",
    "* Completed using Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb or .html format).\n",
    "* Must run completely without errors.\n",
    "* Include data description, result analysis, and final conclusion.\n",
    "* Group presentation with all members participating. Presentation time: Slot 1 of Week 10 according to FAP schedule.\n",
